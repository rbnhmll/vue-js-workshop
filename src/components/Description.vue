    <h2>In this workshop, you will learn the key concepts and techniques
      to get started using Vue.js.</h2>

    <h3>Together you will build a fully functional web application using the Vue CDN,
      as well as the new Vue CLI 3!</h3>

    <p>As websites have become more complex and interactive,
      additional libraries and frameworks have appeared on the scene
      to help make our code manageable and maintainable.
      One of these libraries is Vue.js:
      the most starred open source project on Github with over 110k stars,
      and one of the fastest growing javascript libraries in popularity.</p>

    <p>As a prerequisite, participants should be experienced with HTML and CSS,
      and have a fundamental understanding of JavaScript, the terminal and npm.
      Experience with other reactive libraries like React or Angular is a bonus,
      but not required.</p>
